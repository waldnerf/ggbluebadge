The goal of ggbluebadge is to ...

## Installation

ggbluebadge lives on GitHub for now, so you need to use [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) (or similar) to install it:

``` r
# install devtoos if you don't have it
install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("waldnerf/ggbluebadge)
```

## Color Palette

The colour palette used in ggbluebadge matches the new visual identity of the CSIRO.

From this list, I chose just a few that I thought worked well together for colour and fill scales: main, blues, greys, primary, secondary, and data61.


``` {r main}
ggbluebadge::show_my_palette("main")
```


#``` {r blues}
#ggbluebadge::show_my_palette("blues")
#```

``` {r greys}
ggbluebadge::show_my_palette("greys")
```

``` {r primary}
ggbluebadge::show_my_palette("primary")
```

``` {r secondary}
ggbluebadge::show_my_palette("secondary")
```

``` {r data61}
ggbluebadge::show_my_palette("data61")
```


## Setup theme and scales
There are four variants of the theme-generating function theme_ggbluebadge().

theme_pomological() sets the plot theme to be representative of the paper and styling of the watercolors and includes a paper-colored background,

theme_pomological_plain() has the same styling, just with a transparent (or white) background,

theme_pomological_fancy() has the paper-colored background and defaults to a fancy handwritten font (Homemade Apple).

For color and fill scales, ggpomological provides scale_color_pomological() and scale_fill_pomological().

## To do list:
1. check palettes
2. create palettes for gradients
3. modify scale_* functions
4. check fonts
5. add logo data61

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ggbluebadge)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!

The goal of ggbluebadge is to help R programmers produce figures that are consistent with [CSIRO](www.csiro.au)'s visual identity (the codes within the colours are their hexadecimal codes).

## Installation

ggbluebadge lives on GitHub for now, so you need to use [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) (or similar) to install it:

``` r
# install devtoos if you don't have it
install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("waldnerf/ggbluebadge")
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Color Palette


### The Visual Identity
The colour palette used in ggbluebadge matches the new visual identity of the CSIRO

### Overview of the colour palettes

Official colours can be displayed as follows:

``` {r show-all, fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 3.5}
ggbluebadge::show_csiro_colours()
```



From this list, I chose just a few that I thought worked well together for colour and fill scales: main,  greys, primary, secondary, and data61.



``` {r main, fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 3.5}
ggbluebadge::show_my_palette("main")
```


``` {r greys, fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 3.5}
ggbluebadge::show_my_palette("greys")
```

``` {r primary, fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 3.5}
ggbluebadge::show_my_palette("primary")
```

``` {r secondary, fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 3.5}
ggbluebadge::show_my_palette("secondary")
```



## Setup theme and scales
There are four variants of the theme-generating function theme_csiro():



1. theme_csiro() sets the plot theme,

2. theme_csiro_dark() has the same styling, just with a midnight blue background,

3. theme_pub() is sober theme for publications.


Of course, you can mix and match the themes and the colour palettes... or even create your own (see the vignette for some examples).

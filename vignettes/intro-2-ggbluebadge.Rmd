Now, let's add the CSIRO logo to the figure.


```{r include = TRUE}

p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, color = as.factor(cyl) )) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_color_csiro(palette="data61") +
    labs(
        x = "Weight (tons)",
        y = "Fuel Efficiency (mpg)",
        title = "Just Buy a Convertible",
        subtitle = "Lighter cars are more efficient. Shave off some weight by\nditching the roof, and drive your savings to the bank!",
        caption = "Source: Motor Trend"
    ) +
    theme_csiro()
add_logo(p, logo='csiro')
```
